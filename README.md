# fandango-backend

 Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL were used for the logic and persistence layers of the simulated Fandango.com system, handling common tasks such as browsing, searching and booking movie tickets, as well as generating analytical reports from data aggregated by movie, theater and region. Kafka was used to simplify communication between distributed instances of front-end and back-end services. Redis was added to cache frequent SQL query results.
